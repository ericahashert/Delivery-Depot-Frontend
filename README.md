## Project pitch:

We are creating a database for food delivery that allows a user on the front end to send a request for a dish to a given restaurant and delivery service.

## User story: 

As a user, I am given 5 delivery services to choose from. I can then view restaurants that are provided from a given service, and select any dishes of choice to be delivered. I can add these dishes to my order, then enter my address to get an estimated delivery time as well as the delivery fee. I can then place an order for the selected dishes, and that created order will be sent to your "orders" tab, where it can be viewed.
